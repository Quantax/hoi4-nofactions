Factions no more! Compatible with total conversions.

[b]Update 9 allows selective dismantling of the vanilla starting factions (Allies, Axis and/or Comintern).[/b]

This mod dismantles starting factions (all or chosen vanilla factions) in the beginning of a game and you can also disable all further faction creation. You'll get a pop-up asking you to choose your options when you start a new game.

If you choose to disable all factions, they can still be created from focuses and events but [u]they will be dismantled the next day[/u]. I know this not a perfect solution but it is currently the best way to achieve maximum compatibility with other mods. Due to this small delay between creation and dismantling, things such as "faction created -> war declared -> faction dismantled -> still at war with the former faction members" might happen. However, all war participants will capitulate separately since there is no faction to host GIEs (goverment-in-exile).

Game mechanics, focuses, events and other things that rely on factions (being a member, being a leader, etc.) are essentially non-functional if you disable factions.
